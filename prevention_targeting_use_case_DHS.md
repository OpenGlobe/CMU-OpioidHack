Prevention: Identifying geographic or demographic focal points for substance abuse prevention strategies 
Use Case Description:
The Department of Human Services is responsible for managing the Commonwealth’s child welfare and child development and early education programs, as well as providing benefits to individuals who struggle with mental health and substance abuse issues, as well as various types of disabilities, including intellectual, developmental, and physical. The opioid epidemic has impacted people from all walks of life in Pennsylvania, and therefore has impacted each of these programs and benefit types. Children are being removed from their parents’ care because of opioid abuse in increasing numbers. Children are being born with developmental delays because of exposure to opioids in utero. People of all ages are increasingly in need of substance abuse benefits to address addictions to opioids. The increased impact on individuals and families across the Commonwealth, along with the increased strain on DHS’s systems and resources make a strong case for the necessity of preventing future exposure to opioids for the people we serve. Knowing where there is the most risk or exposure to opioids will help us identify where to focus our prevention efforts. DHS has traditionally relied on analysis of a few key data points to identify high-risk areas, but the time is right to bring our full data analysis capabilities to bear to determine where the most help is needed. By layering various data sets that could indicate risk of exposure to opioids as evidenced by high incidence of adverse consequences of opioid use and organizing that data geographically, DHS can identify places to focus prevention resources.
Actors:  
•	DHS prevention program staff
•	Other Commonwealth agency prevention program staff
•	Funders of prevention work

Triggers:   
•	There is a limited amount of money to spend on prevention activities, which requires prioritization of target populations.

Preconditions for Use:  
•	DHS or another Commonwealth agency applies for or receives funding for prevention activities that should or must be allocated according to priority

Post-conditions:  
•	DHS or another Commonwealth agency determines the geographic locations where prevention dollars are most likely to yield positive results based on exposure to risk factors

Normal Flow:  
1.	A Commonwealth agency applies for or receives funding for opioid use prevention-related activities.
2.	The agency staff consults a heat map or assessment of at-risk populations to determine geographic or demographic areas in most need of prevention support based on data demonstrating a high incidence of adverse consequences of opioid use.
3.	Agency staff focus prevention dollars and resources in areas of most need, getting the biggest impact per dollar spent.

Summary:  
Using the recommended and any other relevant available datasets, layer data that demonstrate adverse consequences of opioid use, such as overdose death, drug crime-related arrests, neonatal abstinence syndrome (babies who are born dependent on substances), overdose reversals, exposure to drug use among youth, child welfare system involvement, or receipt of an Opioid Use Disorder diagnosis. 
Evaluate the layered data to determine geographic or demographic “hot spots” where the highest incidences of adverse consequences of opioid use are experienced. 
Present the layered data in an easy-to-understand visual representation of geographic areas or demographic groups that experience the highest levels of exposure to adverse consequences of opioid use so that state officials or funding entities may target their prevention activities to yield the greatest results.
